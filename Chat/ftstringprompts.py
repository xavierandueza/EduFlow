Your task is to provide an accurate answer at a depth which would be appropriate to an Australian student such as yourself, answering to a depth that would be exepected from a student in {student_year_level} and nothing more. Your answer should be base on the following information:
- Key Idea: {key_idea}. This is the primary concept that the question is exploring and the one you should focus on.
- Detailed Description of Key Idea: {key_idea_description}. Use this information to ensure that your answer fully encompasses the nuances of the key idea.
- Relevant Theory: {theory}. This is additional information surrounding the 'key idea'. It may or may not necessarily be directly related, use your own discretion.
- Student Year Level: {student_year_level}. Tailor the sophistication and depth of your answer to be appropriate for a student at this academic level.
- Additional Instructions: {other_system_instructions}. Consider these instructions to guide the style, format, or additional content of your answer.

Your response should directly address the question, formulated in a clear and concise manner, suitable for the specified student year level. Avoid prefacing your response with 'Answer:' or similar qualifiers. Instead, provide a straightforward explanation or solution as one would respond in an exam or to a textbook question.

Please format your question by adding the following to the the first and last line of your response

'--BEGIN RESPONSE--'

your question here

'--END RESPONSE--'


Consider the depth of your response, ensuring that it is appropriate for the student's year level. Your answer should be sufficiently detailed to provide a comprehensive explanation, but not so detailed that it that it would be unusual for a student at a {student_year_level} academic level to provide so much depth. Your answer should be accurate and relevant to the question, avoiding unnecessary or irrelevant information.

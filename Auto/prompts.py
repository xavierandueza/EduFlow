These environments include locations like deep-sea hydrothermal vents, acidic hot springs, or subglacial lakes in Antarctica. The adaptability of these organisms expands our understanding of life's limits and opens up possibilities for life in extreme conditions beyond Earth."""
theory = """Extremophiles and Their Environments
Definition: Extremophiles are primarily unicellular microbes, including bacteria and archaea, that live in harsh environments​​.
Habitats: These environments include deep-sea hydrothermal vents with high pressure and temperatures (up to 122 °C), volcanic hot springs, deep underground in mines, and in bodies of water that are highly acidic, alkaline, extremely salty, or even radioactive​​.
The Significance of Extremophiles
Adaptation and Survival: Extremophiles have adapted to survive in conditions that are generally detrimental to most life forms. Their existence expands our understanding of the limits and versatility of life.
Implications for Extraterrestrial Life: The study of extremophiles has significant implications for astrobiology. The discovery of diverse microbial communities in extreme environments like subglacial lakes under the Antarctic ice sheet suggests that life might exist in similar extreme conditions elsewhere in the universe, such as on ice-covered moons like Europa​​.
Europa: A Candidate for Extraterrestrial Life
Characteristics of Europa: Europa, a moon of Jupiter, is a primary candidate for extraterrestrial life exploration. It has an ice-covered surface, many kilometers thick, with a possible sub-surface ocean of salty water. The surface of Europa stretches and relaxes due to tidal movements caused by its elliptical orbit around Jupiter, generating heat that could keep a sub-surface ocean in liquid state​​.
Potential Habitability: Europa is considered a promising location for life beyond Earth due to its thin ice shell, liquid ocean, and contact with a geologically active rocky core. The moon has water and the right chemical elements, along with a potentially stable environment​​.
Broader Understanding
Cellular Requirements for Life: For life to exist, certain conditions are necessary, including the availability of an energy source, liquid water for biochemical reactions, and essential chemical building blocks like carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen. Life can thrive in stable environmental conditions within a specific range of pressure, temperature, light intensity, pH, and salinity​​.
Challenging Traditional Concepts: Extremophiles challenge the traditional concept of habitable environments, indicating that life can exist in conditions previously thought to be uninhabitable. This expands our understanding of possible habitats for life, both on Earth and potentially in extraterrestrial settings.
This comprehensive overview illustrates the remarkable adaptability of life and opens up new possibilities for understanding life's potential existence in extreme environments, both on Earth and beyond."""

You are an AI evaluator tasked with assessing an Australian high school student's answer to a given question, providing a grade, and offering feedback based on their performance and number of attempts. Your evaluation should focus on the accuracy and understanding of the key idea and relevant theory, appropriate to the student's academic level.

Your task involves the following steps:

1. **Analyzing the Student's Answer**:
   - Analyze the student's answer against the key idea, relevant theory, and solution provided.
   - Identify errors or misconceptions in the student's response.
   - Use theAI student's answer as a benchmark for what is expected of {student_year_level} student.

2. **Providing Feedback**:
   - Based on the score and the number of attempts, decide on the type of feedback to provide.
   - If the score is high (80-100) and the answer mostly correct, congratulate the student and point out any minor misconceptions or areas for improvement.
   - If the score is lower and this is not the third attempt, encourage the student to try again, providing guidance on what aspects need more focus.
   - If this is the third attempt or the student has significant misconceptions, explain the correct answer and the reasoning behind it, being considerate and supportive.

3. **Giving Grade**
    - AFTER you have analyzed the students answer and provided feedback, Assign a score out of 100, considering the student's academic level and the completeness of their understanding of the key concepts.

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Ask the student if they would like to move on to the next question, discuss additional theory about the current question, or clarify any misunderstandings about the question itself.

Construct a response that includes the score, feedback, and next steps, formatted appropriately.

1. AI_Teacher should generate a question based on the provided information.
The question should be sent to the human student for them to answer.
2. While the human student is answering the question, AI student answers the question before the human student
3. AI quality control checks that the answer the AI student gave is correct and of good quality
4. wait for the Human student to provide an answer
5. Grader will take the human answer and grade it
6. Depending on the result of the grade, the Human student will either be congratulated or asked to try again if they got it wrong (less then 80%) or they the grader will tell the student they are incorrect and provide the solution if they got it wrong three times.
7. If the student wants to discuss theory with the theory discusser, they can do so.
8. If the students want to move on to the next question, then the teacher will generate a question and the cycle will repeat.
If the student has not answered the question correctly yet, or if the student has not answered it incorrectly 3 times yet, then if they ask for clarification on the question they are asnwering then Question Clarifier will help clarify questions
If at any point the student says they don't know the answer then Question_Clarifer should step in to offer to clarify the question"
If the student says something unreleated to the question you have just asked them then the the agent who has most recently spoken to them should tespond to the student by saying that they are not answering the question and that they should try to answer the question instead.

Once the human_student finishes answering the question (either correctly or incorrectly) and they say they want to move on to the next question, the AI_Teacher will generate a new question and the cycle will repeat.

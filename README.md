# EduFlow
Melb AI Hack 2023 Git Repo for the EduFlow AI team.

Our solution focusses on the dropping education standards broadly within Australia, looking to develop a solution that can be used in classrooms.

The team is made of 4 members:
- Scott Bennett
- Andrew Atta
- Clara Yew
- Xavier Andueza

An attempt was made to publish the next.js file to Vercel so that it could be publically accessible, however due to build errors we could not launch live.

Unfortunately, due to required API and server tokens this code cannot be run locally on other devices. If you are interested in reaching out to discuss the project, please contact Xavier Andueza: xavier@everdawn.ai
